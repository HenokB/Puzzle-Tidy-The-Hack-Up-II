# Puzzle for Tidy the hack up II
## Inspiration😁
Inspired by the theme of the hackathon and just to do something that can motivate people to clean their place and take a look at their room.

## What it does⚙️
It's a javascript-based puzzle game that has different images with interesting captions to help people look at their cleaning habits.

## How we built it🎢  
The website is entirely front end and I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GitHub pages to host the website.
## Challenges we ran into🚧
I want to add scores but due to time and working alone while studying for exams I wasn't been able to do it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of🏆
I'm proud to make this hackathon and able to submit a project. 

## What we learned📚
I learned new techniques in JS and CSS.

## What's next for Clean Puzzle🔭🚀
I want to add scores functionality and also to make it shareable to different social media platforms.
